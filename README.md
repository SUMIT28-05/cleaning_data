# cleaning_data
This project focuses on cleaning and transforming raw, unstructured sales data using Power BI. The dataset contained missing values, inconsistent formats, duplicates, and invalid entries. Power Query was used to standardize data types, handle nulls, remove duplicates, and prepare the data for analysis and visualization.
